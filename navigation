The gestures I've found a little lacking, I used Fluid Navigation Gestures to have a little more control over them

Left Edge
    BACK
    Number of actions = 1
    Size = 50%
    Sensitivity = 25%
    Transparency = 100%
    Location = 100%

Right Edge
        Quick = ASSISTANT
        Swipe and Hold = Previous app
    Number of actions = 1
    Size = 50%
    Sensitivity = 25%
    Transparency = 100%
    Location = 100%

Bottom
    BACK HOME RECENTS
    Swipe right = Previous app
    Swipe left = next app

    Number of actions = 3
    Size = 100%
    Sensitivity = 25%
    Transparency = 100%
    Location = 50%



Remove all animations, set the size to maximum, remove any sound (vibration is not supported on this device)

Rotate the triggers and move them away from keyboard should both be enabled.
