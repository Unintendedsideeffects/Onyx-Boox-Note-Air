One of the best features of an eink panel is that zero motion is almost no battery consumption.
This allows you to keep the last thing you were looking at as the lockscreen image, so that when you pick it up you can read it even without unlocking the device.
This is useful when reading but the best use I've found is to have your daily task list there waiting for you and that you can checkout at a glance.
