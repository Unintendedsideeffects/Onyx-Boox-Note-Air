I downloaded Google's Literata and the Amazon kindle fonts, currently using Literata for all my ebooks.
The way I've set this up was to just create a folder on the root of the device storage called Fonts and to sync the same folder on Google Drive to it with autosync, 
so that I can just manage it from any device and have my fonts synced up between devices.
