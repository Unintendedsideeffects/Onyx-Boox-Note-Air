Sync is done with Google Drive.
The idea was to have the device just mirror a set of google drive folders, which is the behavior of the desktop app.
This is however not a functionality of the android app.
I chose Drivesync, and paid for the pro version, and that gives me exactly the functionality I needed.
Some thoughts on the setup:

I created on my Google Drive a folder called "Books"
The structure is as follows:
    Books
        EPUB
        MOBI
        PDF
It's important to note that you would most likely always want to open the EPUB version of a document if you can.
