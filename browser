You should try to use the browser as rarerly as possible, most sites are not optimized for an eink display and the experience is not the best.
I am currently using Firefox nightly because it has the option to autohide the url bar when scrolling, which ideally will be the majority of your time on the web. 
The device CAN reproduce multimedia content and it's fine in a pinch but I have an hard time believing you would rather use it than even a smaller screen device like your phone.

Setting pocket as your homepage is a good way to always have it ready when you want to read something. 
Pocket on the web is a much better than the android version, which I still keep installed just so I have the option on the share sheet to just save an article to it.
